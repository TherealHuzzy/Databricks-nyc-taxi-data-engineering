# 🚖 NYC Taxi Data Engineering Pipeline

## 📖 Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a modern end-to-end Data Engineering pipeline using Databricks, PySpark, Delta Lake, and GitHub.

The pipeline processes the NYC Yellow Taxi Trip dataset using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold), automates data processing with Databricks Workflows, validates data quality, visualizes business insights through an interactive dashboard, and implements Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions.

The objective of this project is to showcase production-oriented data engineering practices including ETL development, workflow orchestration, data quality validation, version control, and CI/CD.

# 🥉 Bronze Layer

The Bronze layer stores the raw NYC Taxi trip records in Delta format with minimal transformation.

### Responsibilities

- Raw data ingestion
- Schema preservation
- Delta conversion
- Historical data retention

---

# 🥈 Silver Layer

The Silver layer cleans and validates the Bronze data.

### Transformations

- Removed duplicate records
- Handled missing values
- Standardized timestamps
- Applied business validation rules
- Improved overall data quality

---

# 🥇 Gold Layer

The Gold layer creates business-ready analytical tables.

Generated datasets include:

- Daily Summary
- Hourly Summary
- Payment Summary
- Pickup Summary
- Vendor Summary

These tables power the reporting dashboard.

---

# 🛡️ Data Quality Monitoring

Automated validation checks ensure reliable data reaches downstream consumers.

Implemented checks include:

- Duplicate detection
- Null value validation
- Negative fare validation
- Negative trip distance validation
- Record count verification
- Business rule validation

If any validation fails, the pipeline stops and reports the error.

---

# 🔄 Workflow Orchestration

The ETL pipeline is orchestrated using Databricks Workflows.

Pipeline execution order:

```
01_ingestion
↓
02_bronze_layer
↓
03_silver_layer
↓
04_gold_layer
↓
05_data_quality
```

The workflow executes automatically according to the configured schedule.

---

# 📊 Dashboard

![Dashboard](docs/dashboard.png)

The Databricks SQL Dashboard provides business insights including:

- Total Trips
- Total Revenue
- Average Trip Distance
- Vendor Performance
- Daily Trip Trends
- Payment Distribution

---

# 🔍 Monitoring

Pipeline execution is monitored using Databricks Workflows.

Monitoring includes:

- Job status
- Task execution history
- Runtime duration
- Failure logs
- Successful pipeline runs

---

# 🚀 Continuous Integration (CI)

GitHub Actions automatically validates the repository on every push and pull request.

The workflow performs the following checks:

- Repository structure validation
- Dependency installation
- Python syntax verification
- Build validation

This ensures project quality before changes are merged.
